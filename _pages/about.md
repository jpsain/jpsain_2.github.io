I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Wright State University](http://www.wright.edu/) working as part of the APEX (U.S. Air Force Academic Partnership and Engagement Experiment)-Analytics research team at the Bioinformatics Research Group (BiRG). I am co-advised by [Dr. Michael L. Raymer](https://people.wright.edu/michael.raymer), and [Dr. Krishnaprasad Thirunarayan](http://knoesis.wright.edu/tkprasad/). Before joining the BiRG, I was a Graduate Researcher at The Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing ([Kno.e.sis](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/lab/knoesis)). I received my MS. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Wright State University](http://www.wright.edu/), and B.Tech in Information Technology from the [West Bengal University of Technology](http://www.wbut.ac.in/).

My research is focused on Natural Language Processing, Information and Knowledge Retrieval and Extraction, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
